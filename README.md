### Devops CLI

Original repo is https://github.com/Gerben/devops-cli, and I just `jbang`-enabled it which results in much simpler source tree and it running anywhere having just Java and jbang installed.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11
- [jbang](https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang)

1. Clone the project : git clone https://github.com/maxandersen/devops-cli.git
2. `jbang devopscli.java {hostname}`

## How to run the project directly

`jbang https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxandersen/devops-cli/jbang/devopscli.java`
